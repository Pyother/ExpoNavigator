# Expo Navigator

This repo contains project of software for vehicle, I've built myself (small, four-wheeled driving robot, built mainly with parts bought from https://Botland.com.pl). Parts of the project:
* **Software for robot** (sketches for Arduino Uno R4 WiFi, which cointain MQTT connection and driving modules).
* **Expo App** - mobile app built in React Native and Expo technology. Someday, this app may be available on App Store or Google Play. This app enables you controlling the vehicle.
* **Visualization** - part of the mobile app, created in Three.js, visualization of vehicle movement.
